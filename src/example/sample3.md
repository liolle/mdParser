# Title Header (H1 header)

This is some placeholder text to show examples of Markdown formatting. We have
[a full article template](https://github.com/do-community/do-article-templates)
you can use when writing a DigitalOcean article. Please refer to our style and
formatting guidelines for more detailed explanations: <https://do.co/style>

## Prerequisites (H2 header)

Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:

- Familiarity with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

## Step 1 — Basic Markdown

This is _italics_, this is **bold**, this is **underline**, and this is
~~strikethrough~~.

- This is a list item.
- This list is unordered.

1. This is a list item.
2. This list is ordered.

> This is a quote.
>
> > This is a quote inside a quote.
>
> - This is a list in a quote.
> - Another item in the quote list.

Here's how to include an image with alt text and a title:

_We also support some extra syntax for setting the width, height and alignment
of images. You can provide pixels (`200`/`200px`), or a percentage (`50%`), for
the width/height. The alignment can be either `left` or `right`, with images
being centered by default. These settings are all optional._

## Step 2 — Code

This is `inline code`. This is a <^>variable<^>. This is an
`in-line code <^>variable<^>`. You can also have
[`code` in links](https://www.digitalocean.com).

Here's a configuration file with a label:

```nginx
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/default]
server {
    listen 80 <^>default_server<^>;
    . . .
}
```

Examples can have line numbers, and every code block has a 'Copy' button to copy
just the code:

```js
const test = 'hello';
const other = 'world';
console.log(test, other);
```
